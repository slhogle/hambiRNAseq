# m02 and m03 are linear mixed models in which the fixed effects are the
# representative intercept and slope for the population and the random effects
# are the deviations in intercept and slope associated with mesocosm id.

# We also consider a model with uncorrelated random effects. This is model m To express this we
# use two random-effects terms with the same grouping factor and different
# left-hand sides. In the formula for an lmer model, distinct random effects
# terms are modeled as being independent. Thus we specify the model with two
# distinct random effects terms, each of which has mesocosm id as the grouping
# factor. The model matrix for one term is intercept only (1) and for the other
# term is the column for Days only, which can be written 0+Days. (The expression
# Days generates a column for Days and an intercept. To suppress the intercept
# we add 0+ to the expression; -1 also works.)

# We also include a polynomial term (m03, m05) since there is some curvature in
# the data over time

# these results suggest that m04 is best fairly closely followed by m02

# Model m02 contains model m04 in the sense that if the parameter values for
# model m02 were constrained so as to force the correlation, and hence the
# covariance, to be zero, and the model were re-fit, we would get model m04. The
# value 0, to which the correlation is constrained, is not on the boundary of
# the allowable parameter values. In these circumstances a likelihood ratio test
# and a reference distribution of a Ï‡ 2 on 1 degree of freedom is suitable.

anova(result$m04, result$m02)

# Because the large p-value indicates that we would not reject m04 in favor of
# m02, we prefer the more parsimonious m04. This is consistent with the AIC and
# BIC values from the compare_performance test (where smaller - more negative -
# is better)
